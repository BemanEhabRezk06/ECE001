        <h2 style="font-size: x-large;"><b><u>What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</u></b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large; width: 80%;">Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligencein machines that
            are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied
            to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and
            problem-solving.
        </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large; width: 85%;" >The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is 
            its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of 
            artificial intelligence is <b><u>Machine Learning</u></b>, which refers to the concept that computer 
            programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. 
            <b><u>Deep learning</u></b> techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts 
            of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;width: 85%" >When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first
            thing they usually think of is <b><u>Robots</u></b>. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like
            machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.

            <b style="font-size: x-large;"><u>Important:</u> </b>Algorithms often play a very important part in the structure of artificial intelligence, where simple algorithms
            are used in simple applications, while more complex ones help frame strong artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%"> The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The
            technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare
            industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.

        <h2 style="font-size: x-large;"><b><u>Categorization of Artificial Intelligence</u></b></h2>
        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%"> Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories:
            weak and strong. <b><u>Weak artificial intelligence</u></b> embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI
            systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and
            Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.

        <h2 style="font-size: x-large;"><b><u>Special Considerations</u></b></h2>

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%">Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny
            from scientists and the public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed
            that humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential
            rate.<a href="Page 4.html">Click For More</a>
