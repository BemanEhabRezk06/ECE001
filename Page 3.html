        <h2 style="font-size: x-large;"><b><u>Categorization of Artificial Intelligence</u></b></h2>
        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%"> Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories:
            weak and strong. <b><u>Weak artificial intelligence</u></b> embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI
            systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and
            Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%"><b><u>Strong artificial intelligence</u></b> systems are systems that carry on
            the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle
            situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be
            found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.
