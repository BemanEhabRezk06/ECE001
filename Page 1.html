        <h2 style="font-size: x-large;"><u>Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)   </u></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;width: 85%" >When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first
            thing they usually think of is <b><u>Robots</u></b>. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like
            machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%"> Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human
            intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily <b><u>Mimic it and Execute Tasks</u></b>, from the most simple
            to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human cognitive
            activity. Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities
            such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent that these can be concretely defined. Some believe
            that innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason out
            any subject. But others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgments that are
            subject to human experience.

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%"> As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial
            intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optical
            character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken
            for granted as an inherent computer function.
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%"> AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines
            are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based on mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and more.
