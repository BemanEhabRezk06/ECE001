        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%"> The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The
            technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare
            industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%">Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include
            computers that play chess and <b><u>Self-Driving Cars</u></b>. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any
            action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For
            self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that
            prevents a collision.

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%">Artificial intelligence also has <b><u>Applications in the Financial
            Industry,</u></b> where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card
            usage and large account depositsâ€”all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also
            being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of
            securities easier to estimate.
