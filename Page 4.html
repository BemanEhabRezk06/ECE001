        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%">Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny
            from scientists and the public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed
            that humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential
            rate.

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%">Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even be
            weaponized. Other arguments debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as
            <b><u>Robots</u></b> should be treated with the same rights as humans.
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%">Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines
            tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of
            colliding with one person or another at the same time, these cars would calculate the option that would cause
            the least amount of damage.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;width: 85%">Another contentious issue many people have with artificial
            intelligence is how it may affect human employment. With many industries looking to <b><u>automate certain jobs</u></b>
            through the use of intelligent machinery, there is a concern that people would be pushed out of the workforce.
            Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers may easily replace
            human labor with machines, making people's skills more obsolete.
